# privatekeys.pw_btc_WebCrawler


A little of story so i was searching the web to find the private key of bitcoin ,ethereum  etc and then i came to the site called privatekeys.pw so there is a private key directory of many cryptocurrencies and all. So its tiresome to press buttons to go to a random page and all.So i was learning selenium and i thought why not create a code that will check random pages and will run until it finds a page in which a private key may contain some bitcoins from btc directory page and that page number is written to a file
