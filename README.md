# privatekeys.pw_btc_WebCrawler


using selenium to go to privatekeys.pw to get the summary of  bitcoin balances in random pages

well beautiful soup could be used rather than going to each web page (but it doesnt work for dynamic pages ), I wanted to try selenium though anyway i dont regret learning it


i am thinking of modifying the code and make it such a way that if the page indeed has a balance then move forward and scrape the address and the private key , i cant promise if  i will do this immediately , i will do it someday when i get some free time 

well with this exisiting code if anybody has found this script useful , please leave a star
